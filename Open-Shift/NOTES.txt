NOTES:

 -	Models.SysLog.UpdateLogFile is defined in Models/SysLog.cs
	It attempts to log an error in a file with the name ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["SystemLogFileName"]
	ConfigurationManager.AppSettings is populated with key/value pairs from the appSettings section of Web.config
	Previously, there were no "SystemLogFileName" and "LogFilePath" keys in appSettings
